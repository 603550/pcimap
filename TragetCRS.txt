For regional analyses, a local UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) zone is often more suitable. UTM divides the world into 60 zones and each zone has an EPSG code. If you're working with a specific location, you can find out which UTM zone it falls into and use that as your target_crs.

There is a Python package named utm that can be used to convert latitude and longitude to UTM and vice versa. This package can also provide the UTM zone for given coordinates.

Here's how you might use it:

import utm

# Get the latitude and longitude for a place
location = ox.geocode(place_name)
lat, lon = location

# Get the UTM zone for the place
_, _, zone_number, zone_letter = utm.from_latlon(lat, lon)

# Construct the EPSG code for the UTM zone
target_crs = f"EPSG:{32600 + zone_number if lat >= 0 else 32700 + zone_number}"


In this code, the from_latlon() function from the utm package returns several values, including the UTM zone number and letter. The EPSG code for a UTM zone can be constructed by adding the zone number to 32600 for northern hemisphere zones and 32700 for southern hemisphere zones.
