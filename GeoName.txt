For autocomplete functionality, you can use a service like the GeoNames API, which has a cities autocomplete endpoint. However, building a fully functioning autocomplete feature would usually require some backend logic, which is beyond the capabilities of a simple HTML page.

Here's a simplified version using JavaScript that makes use of the GeoNames API. Keep in mind that this is a simplified example, and a fully functional implementation could require additional error handling and customization.

First, you need to register a username on the GeoNames website. Then, replace 'your_username' with your registered GeoNames username in the code. The following HTML and JavaScript code create an input field for city names and fetches city name suggestions when the input value changes:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>City Autocomplete</title>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="text" id="city" placeholder="Enter city name">
    <ul id="suggestions"></ul>

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $("#city").on("input", function() {
                var cityName = $(this).val();
                if(cityName) {
                    $.ajax({
                        url: `http://api.geonames.org/searchJSON?name_startsWith=${cityName}&cities=cities15000&username=your_username`,
                        dataType: "jsonp",
                        success: function(data) {
                            var suggestions = data.geonames.map(function(city) {
                                return "<li>" + city.name + ", " + city.countryName + "</li>";
                            });
                            $("#suggestions").html(suggestions.join(""));
                        }
                    });
                } else {
                    $("#suggestions").html("");
                }
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>


To run this code, you can save it as an HTML file and open it in a web browser. When you start typing a city name into the input field, it fetches city suggestions and displays them below the input field. The suggestions are city names where the population is more than 15000. The number of results is limited to 10 by default, but you can customize it using the maxRows parameter in the API request.

Please note that OSMNx might not recognize all city names provided by the GeoNames API, as the two databases may not have exactly the same city names. Also, keep in mind that you would need to handle the selection of a city name from the suggestions to use it for further processing (like passing it to the Python script).
